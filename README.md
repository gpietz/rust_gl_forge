# RustSdl2024

In recent years, I've experimented with the SDL2 library in conjunction with Rust and OpenGL. This year, I aim to revisit and further develop the source codes I've accumulated on this topic.

## Project status 28.01.2024
I am currently very satisfied with and confident in the project's progress. The newly structured BufferObject is highly flexible, capable of managing various data formats. 
I have successfully ported two drawables from the old project to this new structure. These can be toggled using the F1 and F2 keys. I plan to continue developing the project further.
