# RustSdl2024

Over the last few years I have been playing around with the SDL2 library in connection with Rust. This year I wanted to try it again and work on the source codes I have collected so far on this topic.

## Project status 28.01.2024
Currently, I am very satisfied and confident with the project. The new structure of the BufferObject is very flexible and can handle different data formats.
I have ported two drawables from the old project to the new structure, and both can be toggled with the F1 and F2 keys. The project will be continued.
