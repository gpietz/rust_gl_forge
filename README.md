# Rust GL Forge

In recent years, I've experimented with the SDL2 library in conjunction with Rust and OpenGL. This year, I aim to revisit and further develop the source codes I've accumulated on this topic. 
Additionally, I want to gain more experience with GitHub and explore what else this platform has to offer. Updates to this repository are infrequent, as my contributions are limited to my spare time.
